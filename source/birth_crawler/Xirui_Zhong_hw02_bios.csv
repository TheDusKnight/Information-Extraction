https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa was born on August 1, 1979, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the son of Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is of Hawaiian descent and his mother, who is from Iowa, is of mostly German ancestry. Jason was raised in Norwalk, Iowa, by his mother. After high school, he moved to Hawaii, where he landed a lead role, beating out of thousands of hopefuls in the TV series Baywatch (1989) (known as ""Baywatch Hawaii"" in its 10th season). When the show ended, he spent the next couple of years traveling around the world. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to pursue an acting career. In 2004, after the short-lived TV series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character ""Ronon Dex"" in the TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004), which achieved a cult-like following. In 2010, he appeared in the Emmy-nominated HBO series Game of Thrones (2011), playing the Dothraki king, Khal Drogo. To illustrate to the producers that he was Khal Drogo, he performed the Haka, a traditional war dance of the Maori of New Zealand. The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Conan the Barbarian (2011). Four weeks after being cast as the popular Robert E. Howard character, Momoa began shooting in Bulgaria. His approach, like that of the filmmakers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, Pride of Gypsies, in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker. He has directed a couple of short films and is working on his feature film debut Road to Paloma (2014), which is pulled from a series of stories that he's been developing over the years, which he calls the Brown Bag Diaries: Ridin' the Blinds in B Minor (2010). Jason lives with his wife, actress Lisa Bonet, with whom he has two children, Lola and Nakoa-Wolf."

Best known for playing the all-american, philanthropic, athlete ""Jason McNamara"" on the ABC sitcom, The George Lopez show. Also known for playing lead roles in films such as Lionsgate's Jekyll + Hyde and the Indie-Netflix film He's Such a Girl. He played both characters, Jekyll and Hyde in this modern take on the old story, a young man striving to become something more regardless of the consequences. His role in 'Girl' is a far cry from the over sexed, manic killer portrayed in 'Hyde'. Fisher depicts a melancholy, sympathetic character who is constantly taken advantage of. His guest star television roles range from a surfer gone mad, to the perfect boyfriend, a privileged jock, to an east coast bartender, even a tattooed date rapist. He loves all aspects of acting, theater and the process. He currently resides in Los Angeles."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1398781/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"In 1977, aged 8, Declan was taken to the cinema for the first time. He queued for hours. Once eventually inside, he began, as he thought you were supposed to, to run up and down the aisles playing airplanes with a total stranger. The film started and as the Star Destroyer chased the Rebel blockade-runner across the screen, he became transfixed, mesmerized by the spectacle. Star Wars was his introduction into cinema.Poor Declan! Intellectually we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even ill-natured thing in his life. Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession. Obviously, realizing his own shortcomings he made the natural and seamless transition into directing.After a heartbreaking - yet much deserved divorce, Declan returned to education at the tender age of 26 - by embedding himself into the Oxford School of Drama. However, this only convinced him the world wasn't yet ready for his unique anti-acting style, so after this brief incarceration and whilst still remaining painfully under educated and overdressed, he graced his presence upon Bournemouth Film School.Earning a place on the prestigious The Fuji Film Scholarship allowed Declan to make his first narrative film; A Frozen Chicken Saves the Soaps Day - the film was honored to be invited to many of the major European film festivals. He is also rumored to have directed the satirical homage 'Potemkin: The Runner's Cut', starring Charles Dance, which also became entrenched in the International festival circuit.A commission to co-pen two historically drama epics kept Declan in Liquorice Allsorts. Brittania (about Boadicea) and Conqueror (unsurprisingly about William the Conqueror).With his dirty baseball cap at a jaunty angle, Declan took a directing secondment into network television drama on UK cop show The Bill - which resulted in a short-listing in the New Director (Fiction) category at the BAFTA Television Craft Awards which undoubtedly helped Declan become a regular director on several prime-time continuing dramas across all UK terrestrial networks.He then moved into 'Single Dramas' with feature length psychological thriller Wire in the Blood and an adaptation of an Andy McNab novella The Grey Man. BBC's flagship Robin Hood fulfilled his schoolboy mentality before he exchanged (the now VERY dirty) baseball cap for a stetson and went hunting serial killers in Texas with Prayer of the Bone. On the return from distant shores he began cohabiting with vampires, werewolves and ghosts in the pilot of the hit show Being Human and battling dragons and Greek mythological monsters in Merlin and Atlantis.The invention of the spell-checker eventually seduced Declan back into writing - resulting in the whiskey soaked revenge thriller, Broken Cove, (Black List 2014). Despite the typos, the script was also a Nicholl Scholarship quarter finalist. His follow-up script, Numb, was a Final Draft Big Break quarter finalist and Page Finalist (2015). In 2018 he was nominated for an Emmy for directing on Free Rein - which is obviously better than not being nominated.Declan is represented in the UK by Jack Thomas at Independent Talent."

It didn't take him long to abandon that career, and he turned to the production side of the business, working his way up to editor and eventually taking the reins as a director. While much of his directorial output is routine, there are some real gems scattered throughout. My Friend Flicka (1943) is a beautiful, serene tale of a boy and a spectacular horse and was a major success in its day. Although typed as an ""outdoors"" director, Schuster could turn out tough, gritty little thrillers when he wanted to, such as Loophole (1954), about a bank teller who gets framed for an embezzlement; it ranks right up there with the edgy crime dramas of Don Siegel and Phil Karlson. Schuster's western Dragoon Wells Massacre (1957), despite its potboiler title, is a sharp, well-paced effort about two disparate groups of travelers who must band together to fight off rampaging Indians. Good writing, a rousing score and Schuster's tight direction raise this several notches above the product normally churned out by its studio, the usually low-grade Allied Artists. Schuster eventually turned to series television, and finished out his career there."

In close over 50 features and documentaries for television, he has challenged the established Israeli narrative, often facing censorship as a result. His very first television documentary, Mitrasim (1969), first exposed Israelis to the plight of the Palestinian population that was forced from their homes during the War of Independence.

Khirbet Khizeh was a fictional retelling of the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948. Lehem, a landmark drama that was awarded the Prix Italia in 1986, first exposed the problems of the unemployed underclass of Jews.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152104/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"Legendary Chinese actress and singer Zhou Xuan was born on 1 August (year of birth uncertain as either 1918 or 1920) in Jiangsu province, China and originally named Su Pu.At 3, she was sold by her uncle (by deceit) to the Wang family and thereafter her name changed to Wang Xiaohong. Later she was sent to a Zhou family, and there her name again changed to adopt the new family name. The then Ms. Zhou Xiaohong joined the Mingyue singing troupe in 1932 (when she was around 12 or 13 years of age) where she adopted the stage name ""Zhou Xuan"" (Xuan meaning ""beautiful jade"" in Chinese). She started singing on radio and at 14 was selected as the second most popular female singer in China. She soon earned the nickname as ""The Golden Voice"".In 1936, she starred in the movie Street Angel (1937)(Street Angel) which would bring her to fame. In the movie, she played a singer and sang what would become 2 of her most popular hits, ""The Four Season Song""(Si Ji Ge)and ""The Wandering Female Singer""(Tian Ya Ge Nu). She then began to earn a reputation both as an actress and a singer. And went on to make a total of 43 movies in her lifetime.Reportedly, by her own confession, despite the many movies she acted in, she was unhappy with most of them. Her favorite remained her role in the ""Angel"". Other major works include, ""Recall To Jiangnan"", ""Night Inn"" and ""The Secret History of the Qing Dynasty"" (info on movie titles from China Radio International).Her love life however was disappointing. She first married musician/composer Yan Hua and it ended after 8 years in 1941. However, she continued making stage, radio and film appearances during this time, in a total of 16 films between 1939 - 1941.In 1946, after World War II she moved to Hong Kong to star in ""Recall To Jiangnan"" in which she played the roles of two different women at the same time. One an innocent country girl, the other a spoiled party-going girl.From here on, her popularity increased and soon went beyond China and to South East Asia.Around this time or shortly before, Zhou Xuan met Zhu Huaide, a cloth merchant and lived together in Hong Kong. When she became pregnant and thought of marriage, she began to realize that Zhu was insincere and announced their separation in the press.She returned to the newly established People's Republic Of China in 1950 to star in ""The Peaceful Pigeon"", her last movie (one which she would never complete).Later in Shanghai, she gave birth to her first son, Zhou Min.Then came the third man in her life -- the art designer for ""The Peaceful Pigeon"". The love affair ended with her heart broken, and another son, Zhou Wei.Thereafter, she suffered a nervous breakdown, and was regularly admitted to hospitals and mental institutions. She died on 22 September 1957, officially due to brain encephalitis.Her songs remain popular to this day and have been remade by many other singers including greats like Taiwanese Queen of Love Songs, Cai Qin, the late Teresa Teng and the late Anita Mui.Zhou Xuan is estimated to have recorded over 200 songs (114 of them for the movies) and was one of the first Chinese singers to sing with a microphone.Several of her evergreen songs include ""Shanghai Night""(Yeh Shanghai) and ""When Will You Come Again"" (He Ri Jun Zai Lai).Her second son Zhou Wei has written a book with his wife, Chang Jing: ""Zhou Xuan's Diary"", where he provided insights into the legendary singer's life which many didn't know.Zhou Wei and Chang Jing's daughters have both taken a similar path. The oldest, Zhou Xiao Xuan is a pianist and has worked with the Shanghai Media Company. The youngest, Amanda Zhou, is a former figure skater and now also an actress.In June 2004, Hong Kong director Kar-Wai Wong announced he has planned a movie biographing this wonderfully talented actress and singer. Award-winning Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung and Chinese actress Jie Dong have been cast in the starring roles as the elder and younger Zhou Xuan respectively."

His father was a lawyer, judge, and officer in the Continental Army and his great grandparents Philip Key and Susanna Barton Gardiner where both born in England and immigrated to America in 1726.

It was subsequently set to the melody of composer John Stafford Smith's composition ""To Anacreon in Heaven"" and has gone on to be internationally known as ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was adopted as the American anthem by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and further confirmed as such by a Congressional resolution signed by President Herbert Hoover in 1931. Moreover, the stanza ""In God is Our Trust"" was adopted as the national motto by law in 1956. From 1817 to 1843 Key served as the Vice President of the American Bible Society. In 1832 he served as the attorney for Congressman Sam Houston during his trial in the U.S. House of Representatives for assaulting another Congressman.

In the late 1970s he had his own cable public access program in Manhattan, NY.He got his his first paying radio job as an overnight personality at New York radio station WBAI in 1979.

He moved to Albany, NY in 1981 to do an evening show five times a week. The station wanted someone controversial, and Leykis was just that.

However, Leykis states that the callers on his program are not the same as his listeners. He has actually said multiple times that the people that call in and who wait on hold for 30 minutes to talk to Tom live asking obvious questions are usually blue-collar workers who he describe as ""losers"".The free-for-all subject matter and large crowds leads to a rowdy atmosphere on Friday shows.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931616/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"One of the best coaches in college basketball today and possibly ever, Roy Williams was from humble beginnnings. Raised in Asheville, North Carolina, Williams was raised by his mother after his father left them. In Asheville, Williams was on the high school basketball team at T.C. Robertson High School where he was recruited to play at North Carolina by Dean Smith. Although he only played one year of Junior Varsity at North Carolina, Williams stayed to receive his Bachelor's Degree in 1972. The next year, Williams got his M.A.T. from North Carolina and began his coaching career. His coaching career began when he was the coach of the boy's basketball, 9th grade and golf teams at Charles D. Owen Swannanoa High School in North Carolina for five years and served as the athletic director his last two years there. Before the start of the 1978-1979 season, Dean Smith called on Roy to join the coaching staff at North Carolina. During that tenure, the Tar Heels played for two national championships and winning one. Perhaps the biggest coup for Roy Williams as a coach was recruiting a kid from North Carolina who dreamed of having a shoe named after him. The kid: Michael Jordan. Roy's discovery and landing got North Carolina their first national championship under Dean Smith. Carolina continued to have success and Williams was beginning to get consideration for various coaching jobs, but he landed the job at the University of Kansas after the Jayhawks won the 1988 National Championship. Problems awaited Roy when he took the job at Kansas. First, the Jayhawks were placed on probation, yet were able to maintain their status as champions. The other was the graduation of Kansas basketball legend Danny Manning. Despite that, Williams was able to place Kansas in the Final Four twice in his first five years as head coach. Both times, the Jayhawks faced Dean Smith and North Carolina. In 1991, Kansas won, but in 1993, the Tar Heels triumphed. Williams is the fastet coach to win 300 games in NCAA history and may very well be on pace to break his mentor's record for wins in a career. Recently, Williams was offered his dream job at North Carolina when Bill Guthridge resigned as head coach. Career coaching record as of 1/23/2001: 345-83 (.806 Win Percentage)"

She was greeted with cheers, applause, a few coins, and a candy bar, locking in the idea that this could be a future she could sink her teeth into. During her freshman year of drama study at the University of New Orleans, Greta was cast as a Kit Kat Girl in Cabaret and her picture appeared in the local Times-Picayune. This caught the attention of Paramount Pictures and Director Louis Malle, who was in town casting his film Pretty Baby. Mr. Malle cast her as a prostitute and promptly un-cast her when she refused to do a nude scene. A very unorthodox career followed with Greta getting her union card in a Saturday morning children's program, Benji, Zax and the Alien Price, when she was asked to ""fall over a trash can, funny."" She did. As a character actress, she shot on location in a Texas prison for Unspoken Truth with Lea Thompson, called Bingo in Walker Texas Ranger, played dead in America's Most Wanted, sold real estate to Joan Severence in Frequent Flyer, and was Richard Gere's gynecological patient in Dr T and the Women. While working with Brian Dennehy and Cloris Leachman on In Broad Daylight, Greta was escorted off the set during her first day of shooting by an eager PA, who believed her to be a local who had snuck onto the set for the free lunch. Director James Steven Sadwith was summoned to verify her authenticity and Greta was returned to work. Greta had a recurring role in a very short lived sitcom, 13 East and was a regular for 2 seasons in the PBS children's program, Gerbert. She is still recognized for her work with Barney the Purple Dinosaur. As an actress Greta acted in numerous commercials, live industrials and performed with the musical comedy group, Howard and the Fine Sisters, specializing in beehive music of the 1960s.

Details of the journey of Amr Wahba With technological development and the emergence of social media, becoming a celebrity is easy. Filming and publishing a video through these sites and achieving viewership ratios is a frequent occurrence, but achieving success and drawing the attention of the stars to you before the audience is an extraordinary thing.Amr Wahba is a young talent making her way towards fame. The beginning of the audience's knowledge of him was through the social networking sites that gained him fame, to start his journey.He participated in a few works and was able to prove himself, and Ramadan 2019 witnesses a strong start for Amr Wahba, who appeared more through the series ""Badal Al-Hadouta 3"" in two different stories, each of which managed to appear differently.He is Yahya, a quiet young man who loves a girl who is not of his social level, chasing her from place to place and for her to do everything, although the role was a comedy but the girls liked him and wished that Yahya would appear in their lives.And the ""pomegranate"" of the thief who cooperates with his sister in deceiving people, and is not without any attitude he is exposed to from comedy and sense of humor.But before fame and appearing on television, where was Amr Wahba? What did he do in his life?Amr Wahba was born in Port Said, graduated from the Faculty of Languages and Translation, Al-Azhar University, then worked as a marketing officer at the Mobinil Company. When he was young, Amr Wahba did not think that he would be famous. Yes, he loves acting and joking, but not to the point of becoming an actor, until it was coincidence when his friend told him that Akram Hosni searches for a youth book for his program, and indeed he sent them some of his writing and admired him.And because acting and writing is his main talent, Amr Wahba decided to break into this field and began writing satirically, and he was part of the editorial team of the ""Abu Hafidha"" program presented by Akram Hosni, at the time he was writing and sending them while he lived in Port Said, then he decided to come to Cairo to take a greater opportunity He joined a group of several programs like ""Al-Platw"" with Ahmed Amin for one year and ""from duplexes"" with the Fajita costume for a year as well.Amr Wahba not only stopped writing, his ambition was greater, so the satirical videos were his gate to appear in front of the audience and he was accepted, so he listened to the advice of Ahmed Amin, who told him to film videos, and he started with a mockery of some stars and did not fear their annoyance.""Stars You Love Egypt"" Through this program, he commented and donated to the artworks and their stars, sometimes he had sarcastic criticism, but the audience loved his program a lot and achieved fame, so that many stars expressed their admiration for him and did not bother like Ahmed El-Sakka and Amr Youssef who were publishing his videos Or Mohamed Ramadan, who wrote one of his videos.But that did not prevent that someone was annoyed with him, such as Mai Izz Al-Din, who was a little annoyed by his comments on her series, and her fans attacked him, trying to penetrate his accounts.After that, Wahba joined the ""SNL Arabic"" program in the third and fourth seasons, and presented paragraphs that were among the most viewed in the program.The real beginningThe real beginning of Amr Wahba when he started making his first steps in acting, first he received some special lessons and then the opportunity came to him to participate in the movie ""Mewlana"" and although his role was not great, he left a trail in the audience and began to know through it.It seems that Wahba decided at the beginning of his career as an actor to appear differently, as he presented in the series ""Kalbash 2"" the character of the Israeli spy, with a serious performance and scenes of his gathering with ""Salim Al Ansari"" facing him with full force, present the character to the point that if you follow his scenes, he provokes you.The scenes of his choice of the role were due to his participation in ""SNL in Arabic"", as director Peter Mimi recognized him and nominated him for this role, and at that time he told him that for the audience it would not be appropriate for this character, as the Egyptian viewer used to see the spy in a specific form, but Amr Wahba managed to draw He looked at him, even as he was walking in the street and calling him the ""spy"".The audience did not stop, as he received praise from actors, including Ahmed Al-Saqqa, who called him after his first scene in ""Kalbash"" and praised him.After ""Kalbash"", it was necessary to take a comic step to participate in the 2018 movie ""Al-Kwaisin"" with Ahmed Fahmy, Hussein Fahmy, Sherine Reda, Bayoumi Fouad and a group of stars.""Dr. Latif"" is the name of the character he presented and influenced the audience, and explained this through the satirical ""comics"" that spread through social networking sites, and we find most of them use the famous phrase in the movie ""scientifically ... and practically.""And in Ramadan 2019, the biggest opportunity is for him to appear in the series ""Badal Al-Hadouta 3"" in the first story with the character ""Rumman"", the young man who works with his sister in the theft, and the second story, ""Yahya"", a romantic young man who seeks to get closer to his girlfriend.Serendipity collected by Adel ImamAmr Wahba loves the artist Adel Imam very much, and he had enough luck to meet the leader in his house and sit with him for a long time.Wahba recounted during a meeting in the ""An-Nahar Street"" program about a strange coincidence she gathered with the great artist, as he worked for a telecommunications company that had a branch in the northern coast that he used to go to in the summer, and there he met a number of artists, including Salah Al-Saadani and the late Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, and on the day she came He had a lady who knew that she was Sarah, the son of Adel Imam, and he cared for her a lot, and he gave her his phone number to call him if she needed something, and indeed one day she called him and asked for his help so he went to the villa that her father owned and there he met the leader and sat and talked to him for a long time.RadioMany developments in Amr Wahba's career, in addition to acting, he became a radio presenter presenting a morning program on ""Radio Energy"", ""Healthier Energy"", and with his colleague Mai Ibrahim, he presented a radio series entitled in Ramadan entitled ""We want to marry on the Eid."" If you see Amr Wahba in his videos, roles, or even meetings, you do not feel that he has been married for 9 years and has a family and a father for a young child.But from the pictures that he publishes with his son, Yahya, he shows his way of dealing with him and his friendship with him, as he always prefers publishing his diaries with him."

He produced a total of 72 films, among them A Man Called Horse.His heroic stands on behalf of vulnerable people were multiple. While in South Africa filming he took a stand against apartheid by refusing to separate the black cast and crew members from the whites. When the government stepped in to enforce their political agenda, he moved a sleeping bag into the African compound and stayed with the segregated cast and crew. Another example was his imprisonment in Greece for an explosion of the set of Sky Rider, when he offered himself up to anti-American military officials (at the time) to save a crew member from any consequences.Many stars worked with Howard, including Jodie Foster, who got her film break in Howard's Echoes of Summer, a young Sean Connery in Meteor and famed silent screen actress Lillian Gish.

She was born Helen Johnson in New York City on August 1 1906. Schooled in New York, she completed a fine arts course at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs and afterwards continued her studies for another two years in Paris. Returning home, she became a fashion stylist for R. H. Macy's department store and subsequently worked as a commercial artist in an advertising agency. Thus endowed with both looks and intellect, she made her way to California, set up home base in the Hollywood Hills and began acting in films by 1929. Within a year -- still billed as Helen Johnson -- she had received leads in the musical comedy Children of Pleasure (1930), the crime drama Soldiers and Women (1930) and Working Girls (1931), a 'women's picture' directed by Dorothy Arzner. In 1931, she was voted a WAMPAS Baby Star and adopted the stage name Judith Wood. Unfortunately, her year was marred by a traffic accident which resulted in a lengthy recuperation and absence from the screen.In late 1932, Judith appeared on stage in the original Broadway production of ""Dinner at Eight"", playing the part of Kitty Packard, a much coveted role which went to Jean Harlow in the film version a year later. She had another motion picture lead as a blackmailing ex-con in The Crime Doctor (1934) and then, suddenly, her career was unaccountably at an end. Judith herself later suggested in an interview that her many affairs (among others, with stars William Powell and Robert Montgomery) may have had a bearing on her declining fortunes, quoted as saying ""my entire life has been a near miss"". Sometime in the late 30's, she married the son of ""Beau Geste"" author Percival Christopher Wren. After divorcing him, she had several more failed attempts to break back into films, eventually secured work as a radio actress and, finally, as a costume designer, working on ""everything from operas to porno films"". At least, she had the fortune to be blessed with a long life, passing away at the ripe old age of 95 in Los Angeles."

He took this with him when he went to study at Eton and then at the King's College, Cambridge, where he became assistant in classical archaeology at the Fitzwilliam museum. After writing a dissertation: ""The Apocalypse of St. Peter"", he became a Fellow of King's, and then Dean. Although he was renowned in some circles for his biographies, studies into antiques, reviews and palaeography, it was his ghost stories that he would be remembered for. He was keenly engaged in examining the supernatural, and his stories were always written in a way so the reader uses their imagination. The real horror is often kept to the reader's mind. Celebrated cult horror novelist and story writer H.P. Lovecraft was a fan, and wrote a review on his work: ""...gifted with an almost diabolic power of calling horror by gentle steps from the midst of prosaic daily life."" he says, also adding: ""Dr. James has, it is clear, an intelligent and scientific knowledge of human nerves and feelings; and knows just how to apportion statement, imagery, and subtle suggestions in order to secure the best results with his readers."" Although largely ignored by filmmakers - Curse of the Demon (1957) - is one exception), his work has a dedicated fan base, and the BBC filmed several of his stories in the 1970s, wisely titling them under the series ""A Ghost Story for Christmas"". In 2000, horror legend Christopher Lee jumped at the chance to read four of James' stories in another Christmas special screened on BBC2. James' most famous works include ""Ghost Stories of an Antiquary"", ""The Five Jars"", ""A Warning to the Curious and other Ghost Stories"" and ""The Collected Ghost Stories of M. R. James""."

He began his music career in 1979 and has won three Grammy awards, with his 1986 album ""Strong Persuader"" selling over one million copies.Cray's father was a career military man, so although Cray was born in Columbus, GA, he was raised in areas as varied as Virginia, California and Germany due to his father's various postings over the years, but the family finally settled in Tacoma, WA, in 1968. He had begun to study piano while his family was living in Germany, and was musically influenced by such artists as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. He became a fan of The Beatles and eventually switched his choice of instruments from piano to guitar (a lucky meeting with actor John Belushi resulted in Cray's getting a part in the film National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) as a member of the band Otis Day and the Knights). Cray eventually formed his own band and in 1978 signed a contract with Tomato Records, coming out the next year with the album ""Who's Been Talkin'?"". Tomato didn't release it until 1980 and it didn't sell well, so Cray switched to Hightone Records and in 1983 released the well-received album ""Bad Influence"" His next album, ""False Accusations"", didn't break any sales records--although it was favorably reviewed by music critics--but in 1985 he released his breakthrough album, ""Showdown!"", which he recorded with Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland. It garnered him a Grammy and sold a quarter-million copies. The next year he went over to Mercury Records, where he released what many believe to be his best album, ""Strong Persuader"", which got him his second Grammy.Cray embarked on a worldwide tour, playing in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia.

He gained a scholarship to St Martin's School of Art at age 16 and started work as a set painter in the theatre. When he saw a notice asking for song writers it was to change his life. His new name was inspired on a bus journey past St. Bartholomew's Hospital (affectionately known as Barts). He wrote his first musical in 1958, Wally Pone of Soho. It was not a success. However, the songs he wrote for the early British rock'n'rollers Tommy Steele (Rock With the Caveman and Little White Bull) and Cliff Richard (Living Doll - at No. 1 for 6 weeks in 1959) brought Lionel his first taste of success.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0671732/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"Karen Anita Pendleton was born in Glendale and raised in North Hollywood, California. She was the youngest of three children, her sister Yvonne and brother Kent being many years older. Her father was a movie set builder, but Karen had no exposure to show business prior to the show. She took dancing lessons with Elaine Troy from age three, but had never even entered an amateur contest, let alone done professional work. She went to the audition with two other girls from her studio. Afterwards she was asked to sing; it perhaps helped that she recognized one of the judges, Jimmie Dodd, as the fellow who the week before sang at the First Presbyterian Church, which Karen and her family attended.Karen's initial appeal lay in her slightly raspy singing voice and wide-open eyes. She was a good dancer, but that part of her talent wasn't emphasized until the later seasons. For duets, Karen was matched with either Johnny Crawford, who was also a good singer, or with Cubby when no male solo was needed. Johnny was let go midway through the first season, so for the next two and a half years she and Cubby were singing partners.Karen was very popular in the first season, receiving enough fan mail that she was given her own mini-series entitled Karen in Kartoonland. She narrated and starred in this four-part feature that explained how animation worked. In 1956 she was tapped to appear in the Disney movie Westward Ho, the Wagons, along with Cubby, Tommy, and Doreen. Karen had slightly more screen time than the others, but just as few lines.Karen's friends on the set tended to be the girls her own age; she didn't really interact much with the older girls. In the third season, though she was friends with Linda Hughes, she undoubtedly lost some singing parts to her. The Mouseketeer production numbers gradually shifted focus to the teenage kids, leaving Karen with less screen time. She was given the job of introducing the Annette serial episodes, and shared the Mousekartoon introductions with Cubby. When the Rainbow Road to Oz was proposed, she was cast as Polychrome, and had a short song solo and some dancing parts in the Disneyland episode promoting that film project.When the show ended, so did Karen's career. She and Cubby had been offered a contract extension, contingent upon both re-signing, but Karen's father decided against it. She never really liked acting, only dancing and singing, and she found going to auditions an ordeal. Public school was hard for her; she was sensitive and shy, and became a target for teasing about her Mouseketeer days. She continued to work on her dancing with Elaine Troy, and helped give lessons to newcomers at the latter's North Hollywood studio. In 1959, and again in 1960, she went on the Mouseketeer tours of Australia organized by Jimmie Dodd. At odd intervals she would appear in the fan magazines, invited to a birthday bash for Cheryl, or a magazine-sponsored Mouseketeer reunion party.Though Karen and Cubby were never romantically involved, she did go out for a while with Johnny Crawford, and in 1969 appeared on The Dating Game, where she picked Bobby Burgess as her date after recognizing his voice. After high school, Karen went to college for a while, then quit and started working at May department store as a sales clerk. She had some embarrassing encounters with folks she knew from the show, including Cheryl Holdridge, then the wealthy wife of Lance Reventlow, and with Annette's mother. She later went to work for Prudential, again as a clerk. Karen married Mike DeLaurer, a lawyer and a Marine veteran of Vietnam, in 1970. They had a daughter in 1973, but later divorced.In 1983 Karen was in an automobile accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. An event that destroyed a dancer may have been the genesis of a new Karen. She'd always lacked confidence; now, perhaps born of frustration and anger, she forced herself to complete college, earning first a B.A., then a Master of Science degree, in Psychology, while continuing to raise her daughter. She took a full-time job at a shelter for battered women, and testified at government hearings on problems facing the handicapped. In the late 1990's she served on the Board for the California Association of the Physically Handicapped (now known as Californians for Disability Rights), and was director of the Center for Independent Living in her city. In 2004 she appeared on the Disney Treasures DVD interview conducted by Leonard Maltin with several other Mouseketeers, and in 2005 took part in the 50th Anniversary Celebration for the Mickey Mouse Club. She was also awarded a ""Mousecar"" (Oscar) during August 2015 for the MMC's 60th Anniversary, though she did not attend the ceremonies. Karen passed away on Sunday, October 6, 2019, leaving behind her daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren."

At the age of sixteen James is on the verge of becoming a household Hollywood name. With his role in ""Rocky Balboa,"" the sixth film from Sylvester Stallone, James is preparing for the next step.Whatever the next step may be, one thing is certain, James Francis Kelly III is ready. His background in theatre, athletics and academics has given him a breadth of skill and a depth of knowledge uncommonly seen in a teenager. His mature and confident nature make an immediate impact, as they obviously did on Stallone, who cast Kelly to play Steps, the troubled son of a down-on-her luck parent in the film, slated for a December release.While honing his acting skills training at the Lee Strasberg Institute, James was singled out at the young age of nine to act as an assistant acting teacher for summer theatre. He has quietly been perfecting his craft since the age of four and now, as he stands on Hollywood's doorstep, he is ready to make his place.Epitomizing the term ""well-rounded,"" as a high school junior James is already being recruited to play football at many of the nation's top schools-but his passion is for acting. Although he is a captain on his varsity football team, James has also practiced Muai Thai, a traditional form of Thai self-defense, for many years as well as playing other sports such as soccer and racquetball.Also unlike many young adults, James is interested in his cultural background, which has proven to be inspirational. Born to an African-American/Native American mother and a father who is second generation Irish. James has benefited from each of these cultures.

Through his teenage years, he discovered love, loss, pain, joy, and everything in between which is thoroughly recounted in his infamous book ""The Basketball Diaries"".The years recounted in his book tell the stories of what it is too be a boy lost in the city of New York, searching for something of substance, something of meaning and something pure. His stories signify the beauty of innocence and the darkness of its loss. As copies of the diary began to make the rounds in the literary underground, Carroll was being lauded as an important writer as people began to praise his talent beyond his years. Members of the legendary beat generation such as Kerouac and Burroughs dubbed Carroll ""a born writer"".By 1978 The Basketball Diaries was published and Carroll was a genuine literary icon. In 1973 Carroll published ""Living in the Movies"" and he found himself fleeing to California to continue his search for something pure. However the purity he sought was not achieved until the origination of his second diary ""Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries"". The diary recalls his years working under the wing of Andy Warhol at his legendary factory, the entries also illustrate his battle with heroin addiction which he eventually beat.After touring with rocker Patti Smith, Carroll explored the idea of starting his own band. What eventually was concieved was The Jim Carroll Band. The band released three records under the Atlantic Records banner which spoke for a generation of teenagers everywhere.Throughout the 80s and 90s Carroll has continued to stun readers with new publications of poetry and spoken word albums as well as a greatest hits compilation of his band.In 1995 however his work was personified in Scott Kalvert's film. The film property had been purchased by numerous directors who had all failed to produce it. At one point River Phoenix even vowed to get the lead role. The film was released in 1995 with Leonardo DiCaprio playing Carroll. Despite a strong lead performance in the film, ultimately it did not capture the beauty and brutal honesty of Carroll's book. Certain events were changed, characters invented and entire plot devices added for no alleged reason. Carroll is quoted as being ""unpleased"" with the final product.Since then Carroll has put out another compilation of his poetic works and has recorded his first straight rock album of all new material in almost 20 years.Carroll continues to tour his works through live readings and book signings. He remains in his city of origin, New York city, a place where he has experienced a lifetime wrought with exploration and self discovery."

Whilst in the army, he began playing acoustic guitar and learning the craft of finger picking and folk style guitar. Upon leaving the army in 1960, he returned home and carried on with his art studies by taking lessons at college. During this period, he got into the then growing beat and coffeehouse scene which introduced him to many other like minded artistic drop outs including a young poet named Robert Hunter, who would later become his songwriter partner. He studied and practiced guitar nearly ever waking hour and, a year or so later, he picked up 5-string Banjo and began to learn the art of Bluegrass music. Between 1960 and 1964, Garcia played in many different folk and bluegrass acts in which he played Banjo or Acoustic Guitar. He was by now a very serious musician and spending a lot of his time playing and practicing with whoever was around at that time. He could also play a little fiddle, bass and mandolin and sometimes all within the same gig.In 1965, he formed an electric blues-rock band called the ""Warlocks"", with himself as the lead guitarist. A few months later, they changed their name to the ""Grateful Dead"". The original line-up was Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Ron McKernan (Pigpen) and Bill Kreutzmann. They soon gained a reputation for playing long improvised jazz inspired folk-rock music and became one of the most popular live bands around. Garcia became the main songwriter within the group as his partnership with 'Robert Hunter (V)_ matured over time and he led them through many musical changes throughout their long career. Over the next 30 years, the Dead went through many musical and personal changes but they grew in popularity and became the most popular live band in history, playing in some of the most legendary concerts of all time including Monterey Pop (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Watkins Glen (1973).They averaged around 80 concerts a year and had an incredible loyal fan base known as Deadheads. Despite being well known for their live shows, they were also a sublime band in the studio which is often overlooked because of their lack of hit singles; in fact, their only hit single was ""Touch of Grey"" from the ""In the Dark"" album in 1987, a full 22 years after they formed! The band recorded 13 studio albums - Grateful Dead (1967), the semi-live Anthem of the Sun (1968), Aoxomoxoa (1969), Workingmans Dead (1970), American Beauty (1970), Wake of the Flood (1973), From the Mars Hotel (1974), Blues for Allah (1975), Terrapin Station (1977), Shakedown Steet (1978), Go to Heaven (1980), In the Dark (1987) and Built to Last (1989). Their albums and original songs ranged from straight ahead rock and pop influences to blues, folk, jazz, country, electronic and progressive experimentation. They also released many live albums, most notably Live Dead (1969), Europe72 (1972), Reckoning and Deadset (1981) and Without A Net (1990). Garcia had a deep interest in film going back to his childhood. He briefly studied film making at college in the early 60s. His first work of note in feature films came in 1970 when he worked on the soundtrack for the movie Zabriskie Point (1970), where he performed the improvised instrumental guitar piece known in the movie as ""Love Scene"". In 1974, he began a film project that lasted a number of years. Mixing animation and real concert footage The Grateful Dead (1977) was co-directed by Garcia. Other concert and semi concert videos followed with Dead Ahead (1981) and So Far (1987). He also performed a small part in Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), where he provided the brief Banjo playing in a few short scenes.Despite being consumed with 30 years with the ""Grateful Dead"", Jerry also found time to have a whole musical career away from the dead. He began playing in jam sessions and doing session work with other artists in the late 60s. He began playing pedal steel guitar and formed the country-rock group the ""New Riders of the Purple Sage"" with John Dawson in 1969. He released his first of 5 solo albums - Garcia (1972) in which he played every instrument except drums. Compliments of Garcia (1974), Reflections (1976), Cats Under the Stars (1978) and Run for the Roses (1982). His band, The Jerry Garcia Band, was formed in the early 70s and it gave him a chance to perform many other songs and styles of music outside of the Dead. The band went through many personal changes and name changes during its time but it allowed him to play any type of music he liked, and he did. He covered jazz, blues, Motown, R&B, gospel, pop, reggae, swing, ballads, Dylan covers and was equally at home playing any of them. In 1973, he formed a bluegrass band called ""Old and In the Way"" in which he played Banjo, it was a short-lived group but the record that was later released went on to become the biggest selling bluegrass album of all time.The Dead and the scene they came out of was legendary for drug taking and Jerry was no exception and, by mid 70s, he had gotten into hard drugs, including cocaine and heroin. By the mid 1980s, it had slowed down his creative process and he was by now a very heavy user and suffering many health problem which all came to a head in 1986, when he went into a coma and nearly died, spending some considerable time in hospital recovering. But it didn't stop him from his continued musical quest and, after his recovery, he returned to touring and recording with the Dead and his own versions of the Jerry Garcia Band. In 1990, he reconnected with old friend and former ""Old and In the Way"" band mate David Grisman. Grisman was by now a musical giant and one of the greatest Mandolin players of all time. They formed an easy going relaxed acoustic double act which involved a few gigs and many hours worth of sessions at Grisman's home recording studio. Garcia/Grisman was released in 1990 then followed Not for Kids Only (1992) and, since then, 4 more studio albums of the recordings have been released - Shady Grove, The Pizza Tapes (with Tony Rice), So What and Been All Around This World as well as the movie Grateful Dawg (2000) which pays tribute to the musical friendship they shared. They played all different styles of music and the period probably represents Garcia's best work as an acoustic guitarist.Garcia continued touring with the Dead, his own band and recording with Grisman and others on session work right up till 1995 when he again tried to tackle his drug addiction and his overall health problems which included breathing troubles caused by years of heavy smoking and his love for junk food and lack of exercise meant he spent the last number of years of his life vastly overweight. He entered the Serenity Knolls treatment center in Marin County, California in an attempt to clean up and get healthy. In the early hours of August 9 1995, he suffered a massive heart attack and died. He was 52 years old.As well as all his Grateful Dead and solo Band work, he also clocked up a lot of studio time with other recording artists and he played on over 50 studio albums by other artists including the likes of the Jefferson Airplane, Jefferson Starship, Tom Fogerty, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, David Bromberg, Robert Hunter, Peter Rowan, Warren Zevon, Country Joe McDonald, Ken Nordine, Ornette Coleman, Bruce Hornsby and Bob Dylan and many more.Often given the clichéd title by the media of being the smiling easy going hippie who never sold out or let us forget the 60s and what it stood for. It should be remembered that Garcia was a talented and dedicated musician capable of playing not only guitar but piano, bass, banjo and pedal steel guitar all to a very high standard as well as being an underrated songwriter. It will be his guitar playing that he will be most remembered for as he was a brilliant guitarist capable of playing any genre or style of music in any setting with anybody and either electric or acoustic. He was a rare genius."

Rockwell's characters are as intricate as they are flawed. He abstains from the shotgun pop of mainstream film and uses classical techniques and sheer creativity to tell his stories.Rockwell hails from Boston, Massachusetts. It is fair to say that Alexandre has film-making in his blood. His grandfather, the Russian-born animator Alexander Alexeieff, and his grandmother, American artist Claire Parker, met and married in France. They spent their lives making animated films together and famously originated pin-screen animation. Rockwell went to Paris to train in filmmaking with his grandfather during his late teens. He later attended the Cinémathèque Française where he formally studied the craft.Rockwell managed to establish himself by the early 1980s. He already had several short films under his belt and his work was shown at Boston's Institute for Contemporary Art and New York City's Association of Independent Video and Film. This led to him landing his first feature film, Lenz (1982) which was shown at the 1982 Berlin Film Festival and enjoyed success. Rockwell followed up with the release of Hero (1983), which won a Special Jury Prize at the 1984 Sundance Film Festival. In 1986, he married Yale graduate and Flashdance (1983) star Jennifer Beals. He didn't make any films until Sons (1989).Praise rained on Rockwell at The Sundance Film Festival when he released In the Soup (1992). The movie featured Steve Buscemi, Seymour Cassel and Jennifer Beals. Rockwell's next film Somebody to Love (1994) was less successful, though the omnibus movie Four Rooms (1995) was popular, in which Rockwell directed the segment ""The Wrong Man"". Rockwell's marriage to Beals ended in 1996 but they remained close friends. Unfortunately, Rockwell's next offering, Louis & Frank (1998), reprising two minor characters from In The Soup, flopped with audiences.Rockwell hit his stride again with the release of the successful 13 Moons (2002), a comedy which featured a strong ensemble cast including Steve Buscemi and Karyn Parsons. Rockwell later married Parsons (best known for her work as ""Hilary Banks"" on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990)) on Valentine's Day, 2003. After Pete Smalls Is Dead (2010), he made the critically acclaimed Little Feet (2013), starring his two young children, son Nico and daughter Lana, which was entirely funded by a Kickstarter campaign. With this feature, Rockwell continued the form that made him an iconoclast of the independent New York film movement of the nineties. After a break of 7 years, he returned to filmmaking with Sweet Thing (2020), starring his wife Karyn and their two kids, winning the Crystal Bear award at the 2020 Berlin International Film Festival."

""Gangsta's Paradise"" would also be featured on the ""Dangerous Minds"" soundtrack and movie. ""Gangsta's Paradise,"" also featuring LV on vocals, was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Song of the Year and it sold over six million copies and was Billboard Magazine's number one single in 1995. The world recognition led to his music being featured Coolio for several major motion pictures including: Space Jam, Clueless, The Big Payback, Panther, New Jersey Drive, The Jerk Boys, Eddie, Half Baked and many more. He also composed the theme song for the popular kids TV series Kenan and Kel on Nickelodeon. The awards for his hard-hitting style are many.

Television appearances included programs like Celebrity Cook Off and Celebrity Chopped. His musical collaborations continued with ""From the Bottom to the Top."" Coolio changed his style and opened up to working with many European and International disc jockeys such as Benny Benassi, Ives la rock, and Paul Oakenfold just to name a few. He also got the aide of his son A.I., who was a featured artist on the album. The first single is collaboration with Coolio and the Oscar-winning ""Ennio Morricone,"" one of the most famous soundtrack composers of the last 50 years. Coolio's Album ""El Cool Magnigico"" was released in Europe on Jan 15, 2003. Featured artists on that album included hip-hop performer Miss Toi, country legend Kenny Rogers, Krazye Bone from Bone thugs n Harmony, B-real of Cypress Hill and Daz Dillinger. Associated Press stated that, ""Coolio returns to Hip-Hop with El Cool Magnifico, and every track on the disc is a winner.""

No stranger to the world of cartoons, Coolio recorded the single and music video ""Dexter"" (what's his name) for ""Dexter's Laboratory: Home Boy Genius - The Hip-Hop Experiment."" This was a creative and fun album featuring big name hip-hop artists such as De La Soul and Will I Am. ""The Hip-Hop Experiment"" album features original songs inspired by Dexter's Laboratory, the top rated, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network series. An ingenious chameleon, Coolio launched his book, ""Cookin' with Coolio: 5 Star Meals at a 1 Star Price,"" in 2009, which would become a New York Times bestseller. This move expanded his audience base from the stage to kitchens across the globe. Branding himself as the ""ghetto gourmet,"" Coolio used his creativity and the inspiration of his mother to refine old-school recipes into accessible, fresh options. Coolio's interest in cooking started as a youngster. After a failed grilled cheese, his mother chose to make him pay her back for the charred mess by helping out in the kitchen. Rather than hate every minute of cleaning and scrubbing, Coolio fell in love with cooking. Later in life, when his mother passed, the love of cooking turned into an obsession with rediscovering and reinventing all her old recipes. He interviewed aunts, friends and relatives until he found her lost secrets. Then, Coolio took the lessons of his elders and morphed the recipes into healthier options that remained affordable. The secret ingredient of Coolio's recipes is his unconventional approach to culinary instruction. His style is brash and in your face for which he doesn't apologize. ""People learn better when they're entertained. Cooking isn't just for the starched-stiff elite. Everyone should know how to cook something,"" said the ghetto gourmet. Performing and touring worldwide as a musical artist, Coolio is also working on a new cookbook with his best friend and band mate, hip hop jazz saxophonist Jarez. The recipes will continue on the theme of insane deliciousness that anyone can recreate. The recipes are designed to be accessible with easy to assemble ingredients that everyone will recognize. From the tang of balsamic vinegar to the freshness of chopped peppers, the new cookbook is something that everyone needs in their kitchen."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428736/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"Marcia Mae Jones was born on August 1, 1924, to an acting family. Her mother, Freda Jones, was an actress, and all three of her siblings - Margaret Jones, Macon Jones, and Marvin Jones - were child actors. But Marcia Mae had the most successful career, and she was the only one of her siblings to become a child star. She made her acting debut when she was just six months old, when director James Cruze saw her in her baby carriage and immediately cast her as the baby in his film Mannequin (1926). Her first major role was in Night Nurse (1931), in which she played a sick child that a sinister hospital staff was trying to murder. By age 10, Marcia Mae had appeared in several dramatic films. In 1936, she played a terrified victim of school bullying in These Three (1936), a role that brought her much attention. In 1937, she played the crippled Klara in Heidi (1937). The film starred two other child actors, Delmar Watson (as with Marcia Mae, all of Delmar's siblings were actors) and Shirley Temple. Despite a four-year age difference, Marcia Mae and Shirley acted well with each other, and they appeared together again in The Little Princess (1939). Besides Shirley Temple and Delmar Watson, Marcia Mae worked with several other child stars of the 1930s, including Jane Withers, Bonita Granville, Jackie Moran, Sybil Jason, and her favorite, Jackie Cooper.

The son of a lawyer, he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during WWII before receiving his college education at the University of British Columbia. Intending on following in his father's footsteps in the field of law, he supported himself in school with a job doing radio theatre with the Canadian Broadcasting Co.Continuing to pursue his interest in acting for a time in Seattle, he married fellow actress Peggy Hassard and subsequently made a major move in 1948, at age 26, to England where he slowly built up a fine, steadfast theatre reputation for himself along with occasional radio, film and TV roles. Making his London stage debut with ""Home of the Brave"" in 1948, he achieved major attention playing Cornelius Hackl in the Thornton Wilder classic ""The Matchmaker,"" a role he took successfully to Broadway. Other important work on stage included ""Man and Superman"" (1951) and ""Look Homeward Angel (1957). In 1962, he, Uta Hagen, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon bowled over Broadway audiences as the vitriolic foursome in Edward Albee's towering drama ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". Hill won both the Tony and New York Drama Critics awards for his role as George, the weary, broken and thoroughly browbeaten husband of Hagen's emasculating Martha.This choice opportunity led to stable work in Hollywood films in the 1960s with stalwart support roles in The Ugly American (1963), Harper (1966), Rabbit, Run (1970) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). This, in turn, led to an abundance of TV work in the 1970s where Hill found a comfortable white-collar niche as mild-mannered, gray-haired professionals and an occasional shady villain. He earned star status with his own series Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law (1971), and in such quality mini-movies as Death Be Not Proud (1975) and Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys (1976), among others.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0635330/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm,"Eduardo Noriega Gómez was born in Santander, Cantabria, Spain. The youngest of 7 siblings, he had shown a very big talent for artistic activities since he was a child. He began taking piano lessons and got into the Santander Music Conservatory, where he studied for five years. His music professors discovered that he had many conditions for playing piano, so they would keep him practicing for hours until he got tired of it and quit. After finishing high school, he decided to become a lawyer and majored at University of Santander, one of the most prestigious universities in Europe.That wouldn't last long either, because he got the acting bug by chance when attended an acting class alongside a friend that wanted to be an actress, he was invited to participate and enjoyed it enough to do that for living. At 19, he relocated to Madrid to start his drama classes at the R.E.S.A.D. (Madrid Acting Conservatory) and tried to continue with Law School attending the U.N.E.D. (a college where people can study even if they live far away), but due to the time the acting classes demanded him, couldn't focus on his other career and quit after passing the first signature. Once at the Conservatory he met Mateo Gil and Alejandro Amenábar, who was searching for good average students to make his first short films. Noriega shot a few shorts with both of them until he landed one of the starring roles in Amenábar's opera prima Thesis (1996). This movie became the most successful movie of the year in Spain and Eduardo Noriega and Fele Martínez became huge stars. In 1996, Eduardo had a tiny part in Pedro Olea's Más allá del jardín (1996) and the main role in Question of Luck (1996), shot in San Sebastián. During the making of this movie, his mother passed away and he channeled his grief into work by making Open Your Eyes (1997), another Amenábar's movie that became one of the suspense classics worldwide. This part gave Noriega his first Goya Award nomination, but he lost to Fernando Fernán Gómez, although he was consecrated as a very promising actor. Soon after, he tried himself in comedy by taking part in the movie Cha Cha Cha (1998) where he showed his skills as a comedian and met who would be his girlfriend for two years: Ana Alvarez. The relationship ended in good terms and afterward, he arrived to Argentina to make another movie that would become a cult one: Burnt Money (2000). This flick won the Goya Award in 2001 and Eduardo met his now friend Leonardo Sbaraglia. Between 2001 and 2004, he made movies in France, Madagascar and Spain. 2004 was the year that gave him the chance to play a real life character for first time in the movie Wolf (2004). He played Txema, an insider infiltrated in ETA who gave information to the government to dismantle the terrorist group. Critics and people loved his interpretation and earned him a second Goya nomination. Next year, he had the chance to play another controversial character: Che Guevara, becoming the first Spanish actor to play it. In 2006 Master Kowalski (2006) was released at the same time that the theater play and became a blockbuster in Spain and Argentina, Marcelo Piñeyro was the director and also had directed Burnt Money (2000). His most challenging role was yet to come, nevertheless: Vicente Aranda was preparing to direct Lolita's Club (2007)and also looking for an actor who dared play twins who where identical in the outside but totally different inside, because one was a violent smart cop and the other one a mentally retarded sweet man. On December 3, 2007 he won the GQ award as the ""Actor of the Year"". In 2008 he participated in two American movies: Vantage Point (2008) and Transsiberian (2008). In 2009 he re-teamed with Amenábar (this time as a producer, not director) in For the Good of Others (2010), where he had to look older to play an apparently cold-blooded doctor that used to deal with terminal patients, but his life is stricken when his teenage daughter becomes his patient. With this movie, Eduardo showed his maturity as an actor and next year he could fulfill a dream: making a western. Blackthorn (2011) told the story of Butch Cassidy in exile while staying in Bolivia. Sam Shepard and Stephen Rea were part of this superb cast as well. During the half of 2011 a new suspense TV series called Homicidios (2011) began to be promoted on channel Tele5. This thriller meant the return of Eduardo Noriega to television (he had only had a small part in the 1994-1996 show ""Colegio Mayor""). ""Homicidios"" premiered on 20 September 2011 in prime-time with a very high rating. Although it was switched to different times until even midnight, it had the highest audience of his all time branches. In 2013 he will release the movie The Last Stand, alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger."

Quickly, he excelled as an athlete, becoming a member of the Canadian National Pentathlon Team and achieving silver medals from both the Pan American and Pan Pacific Pentathlon Championships for riding and fencing. Although Kris was an extremely talented athlete, both his financial situation and his interests lead him into the acting world.In 1994, Holden-Ried joined a small agency in Montreal in the hopes of making some money, so he could continue his education. His first audition that came up was for the title/leading role in ""Young Ivanhoe,"" a 12th century dramatic, children's period piece TV movie. Kris had the skills, the look, and luckily, as it turns out, the talent. He landed this first audition and has been working as an actor ever since.Kris currently stars as 'Dyson,' in the Syfy series Lost Girl, where he portrays a very likable werewolf-shifter, working in the human world as a police detective. You can also see Kris as Quint in the fourth Underworld installment, Underworld Awakening, and The Returned.Viewers may also know Kris as 'William Compton,' on Showtime's former hit series, The Tudors, (2007,) as he has been working nonstop for nearly two decades. Other credits include multi-episode arcs on Degrassi: The Next Generation, M.V.P. and The Bridge. His film credits also include K-19: The Widowmaker, Gossip, amongst others. To improve his craft, Holden-Ried has trained with Uta Hagen's Master Class Scene Study, and with Janine Manatis of the Actor's Studio NY and the National Film Acting School.When Kris isn't acting, he enjoys adventure, traveling, and being outdoors. Some of his interests include sailing, scuba diving, surfing, and yoga, with one of his favorite films being Gandhi. If he could work with anyone, it would be some of the great, classic directors, such as Scorcese, Scott and Spielberg, as Kris would love to transition behind the camera one day. Kris live in Toronto with his son and his Black Labrador, Hopper."

Brooks once quipped that, whenever he hired Dom DeLuise for one of his films, he would instinctively add another two days to the schedule because of the constant laughter Dom provided on the set -- especially when the camera started rolling.The lovable, butterball comedian was a mainstay on 1960s and '70s TV variety as a ""second banana"" or comedy relief player. While his harsher critics believed his schtick was better served in smaller doses, Dom nevertheless went on to find some range in a few moving, more restrained projects. Those few glimpses behind all the mirth and merriment revealed a dramatic actor waiting to be unleashed. As they say, behind every clown's smile, one can find a few tears.He was born Dominick DeLuise on August 1, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents John, a sanitation engineer, and Vicenza (DeStefano) DeLuise, both Italian immigrants. A natural class clown, it helped Dom fit in at school, and he started drawing belly laughs fairly young on stage. His very first school play had him portraying an inert copper penny! He later attended New York's High School of Performing Arts, but when it came to college, he decided to major in biology at Tufts University near Boston. He never got the idea of being a comedian out of his head, however, and the obsession eventually won out.Dom's formative years as an actor were spent apprenticing at the Cleveland Playhouse in which he gamely played roles in everything from ""Guys and Dolls"" and ""Stalag 17"" to ""The School for Scandal"" and ""Hamlet."" He earned his first professional paycheck playing Bernie the dog in a production called ""Bernie's Last Wish."" Dom also got a taste of the camera in Cleveland appearing on the local TV kiddie's show ""Tip Top Clubhouse.""Back in NYC, he took over the lead role of Tinker the toymaker in another children's local program, Tinker's Workshop (1954), for one season in 1958. He also started making noise on the off-Broadway scene. Appearing in the plays ""The Jackass"" and ""All in Love,"" he became part of the featured ensemble of the 1961 musical revue ""An Evening with Harry Stoones,"" which included 19-year-old Barbra Streisand. More outlandish musical roles came his way in the early 1960s with ""Little Mary Sunshine"" (as Corporal Billy Jester) and ""The Student Gypsy, or the Prince of Liederkrantz"" (his Broadway debut as Muffin T. Raggamuffin). While appearing in the light-hearted summer stock spoof ""Summer & Smirk"" in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Dom met fellow performer Carol Arthur (née Carol Arata). They married on November 23, 1965. Their three sons, Peter DeLuise, Michael DeLuise and David DeLuise all got into the show business act. In 1971, Dom returned successfully to Broadway in a perfectly-suited Neil Simon vehicle, ""The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.""Dom was first noticed on the smaller screen creating the sketch character of Dominick the Great, a magician who tries in vain to mask his ineptness with feigned dignity on Garry Moore's popular show. The rolypoly comedian truly thrived in this TV variety atmosphere and soon began popping up all over the place (The Hollywood Palace (1964), The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967), The Jackie Gleason Show (1966)). Balding, blushing, dimpled and moon-faced (comparisons of a ripe tomato were not off the mark), he was readily equipped with a beaming, clench-toothed smile that became his trademark. At his best, looking embarrassed or agitated, the laughs usually came at his own expense whether playing a panic-stricken klutz or squirming Nervous Nelly type. Dom took the magician character to the ensemble comedy show The Entertainers (1964), which also showcased Carol Burnett and Bob Newhart, and found more regular employment as a bumbling private eye in puppeteer Shari Lewis' daytime children's program and as a foil for Dean Martin on the entertainer's regular and summer replacement shows. Dom again repeated his Dominick the Great character on Martin's show and received great reception. He later found himself part of Martin's ""in-crowd"" of comedians on his ""celebrity roasts.""Dom's obvious comic genius was more apparent and succeeded better in tandem with others than it did on its own. Hosting duties for his very first comedy/variety program The Dom DeLuise Show (1968), which featured wife Carol as part of the regular roster, lasted only one summer. The sitcom Lotsa Luck! (1973), which showcased Dom as bachelor Stanley Belmont having to contend with a live-in mother (a harping Kathleen Freeman) and sister (an ungainly Beverly Sanders), was canceled after its first season. He gave it a rest for awhile before trying once again with the sketch-like sitcom The Dom DeLuise Show (1987), but it, too, quickly faded. Another brief stint was as host of a revamped Candid Camera (1991).While Dom made an unlikely film debut as a high-strung flier in the gripping nuclear drama Fail Safe (1964) starring Henry Fonda, it was in zany, irreverent comedy that he found his true calling. Appearing in support of others such as Sid Caesar and Mary Tyler Moore, respectively, in the so-so comedies The Busy Body (1967) and What's So Bad About Feeling Good? (1968), he proved a delight as an inept, dim-witted spy in the Doris Day caper The Glass Bottom Boat (1966).Mel Brooks first cast Dom as the miserly Father Fyodor in his film The Twelve Chairs (1970), and found plenty of room for the comedian after that -- as campy director Buddy Bizarre in Blazing Saddles (1974), the silly-ass director's assistant in Silent Movie (1976), Emperor Nero in History of the World: Part I (1981), the voice of the cheese-oozing Pizza the Hutt in the ""Star Wars"" parody Spaceballs (1987), and as Sherwood Forest's very own puffy-cheeked Godfather, Don Giovanni, in Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993).A very close friend of action star Burt Reynolds, Dom romped through a number of Reynolds' freewheeling films as well, including Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), The Cannonball Run (1981) and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). One of his finest scene-stealing film roles, in fact, was as Reynolds' schizo pal in The End (1978). Dom went on to direct a number of stage productions for his close friend at the Burt Reynolds Theatre in Jupiter, Florida -- among them ""Butterflies Are Free,"" ""Same Time, Next Year"" (starring Burt and Carol Burnett), ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" (starring son Peter), and the musical ""Jump"" (featuring wife Carol). Still another comic buddy, Gene Wilder, handed Dom the roles of the indulgent opera star in The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975) and perturbed movie mogul Adolf Zitz in The World's Greatest Lover (1977). Dom later joined Wilder once again, along with Wilder's wife Gilda Radner, in the unfunny comedy Haunted Honeymoon (1986), a lame, creaky-house spoof that even Dom in full drag could not salvage.Change-of-pace roles were few in the offering. One occurred for Dom as the compulsive-eating protagonist in Fatso (1980). Directed by and co-starring Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft, Dom managed to draw both comedy and pathos. Obesity was also a chronic, real-life problem for the comedian and, at one point in 1999, it was reported that he had tipped the scales at 325 lbs. On a positive note, this passion for food actually fed into a more lucrative sideline -- as a respected chef and culinary author (""Eat This"" and ""Eat This Too"") in which he appeared all over the tube cooking and demonstrating his favorite recipes. He also wrote children's books on the sly.Dom tackled broad comedy films with great abandon -- a wallflower he was not -- but it was a hit-and-miss affair. Some of his biggest misses were the Mae West disaster Sextette (1977), the Dudley Moore showcase Wholly Moses! (1980) (although Dom was arguably the best thing in it), Loose Cannons (1990), in which he appeared as portly pornographer Harry ""The Hippo"" Gutterman, Driving Me Crazy (1991), which filmed far away in Germany, and The Silence of the Hams (1994) [aka The Silence of the Hams], a parody on the horror genre in which he played Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza.Films could also be a family affair. True to life, Dom played a sympathetic kiddie show host in the moving TV-movie Happy (1983). Also the executive producer, he was joined by wife Carol and all three sons in the cast. In addition, Dom offered a cameo in Between the Sheets (2003), a film that was written by Peter, was directed, edited and executive-produced by Michael, and featured roles for the rest of the family.Dom's voiceover skills did not go by untapped either, which included the animated feature films The Secret of NIMH (1982), An American Tail (1986) and All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989), plus all of their offshoots. The heavily-bearded DeLuise even displayed scene-stealing antics on the operatic scene, once playing the speaking part of Frosch the Jailer in the operetta ""Die Fledermaus"" at the Metropolitan Opera.Suffering from various physical ailments in later years, some of which were exacerbated by his chronic obesity and diabetes, Dom's health declined, and he died in 2009 at age 75. His wife and three children survived him, as did three grandchildren."
